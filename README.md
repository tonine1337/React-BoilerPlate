# React Boiler Plate

This project is maintained by me. It is currently using React v17 and we support the use of React Hooks. We urge the developers to use React Hooks whereever possible and reduce the use class based components.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm lint`

Runs the linter and check all the lint issues.

### `npm run build`

Runs the webpack build and generates a `dist` folder at the root of the application.

### `npm run test`

Runs the test cases written in the `__tests__` folder.
